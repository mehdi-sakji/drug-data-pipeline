## üìà Scalability: Handling Large Data Volumes

### ‚ùì Question

What changes should be made to your codebase to handle large-scale datasets (e.g., files with several terabytes in size
or millions of files)?


### ‚úÖ Answer

To effectively process large datasets (such as multiple terabytes or millions of files), several architectural, 
technological, and code-level changes should be considered. Below are key recommendations.


### 1. Use Efficient Storage Formats

Avoid formats like CSV or JSON for large-scale storage and switch to optimized columnar formats:

- **Parquet** or **Avro**: Columnar storage formats that support efficient compression and I/O performance.
- **Benefits**:
  - Faster read/write for large datasets.
  - Supports schema evolution.
  - Compatible with big data scalable storage systems.
  - Compatible with distributed processing systems.

Use these formats when reading from or writing to data lakes to minimize memory and improve speed.


### 2. Store Data in Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

For scalable, cloud-native storage:

- **GCS as data lake**: Store raw and processed data efficiently and durably.
- **Partitioning strategy**: Organize files into partitioned directories (e.g., by date or source) to optimize 
query performance.
- **Delta Lake compatibility**: Use DeltaLake for versioned data and transactional integrity.
  - Delta tables maintain a transaction log that tracks updates, inserts, and schema changes over time.
  - Enables efficient upserts and time travel for large datasets.


### 3. Use Distributed Computing Frameworks (e.g. Apache Spark)

Large volumes of data require distributed computing:

- **Apache Spark**: Supports parallel processing and distributed memory.
- **PySpark**: Python API for Spark, enabling use of:
  - **DataFrames** for optimized, in-memory data processing.
  - **Spark SQL** for SQL-style queries on distributed data.
- **Benefits**:
  - Scalable across clusters.
  - Tolerant to node failure.
  - Easy transition from Pandas-based code.

### 4. Deploy at Scale with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

If maintaining a Iaas Python-based application architecture:

- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**:
  - Supports horizontal scaling and rolling deployments.
  - Useful for real-time workloads and custom Python APIs.
  - Integrates well with CI/CD pipelines and autoscaling infrastructure.
  - Enables multi-cluster strategies and high availability setups.

Alternatively, consider migrating to PaaS offerings for reduced ops overhead.

### 5. Use Google Cloud Dataproc (Managed Spark)

For serverless, managed Spark processing:

- **GCP Dataproc**: Deploys and manages Spark clusters with ease.
- **Autoscaling**: Automatically scales resources based on workload demands.
- **Simplified maintenance**: No need to manage cluster provisioning or deprovisioning.
- **Tradeoff**: Might require moderate code refactoring to align with distributed execution patterns.


### 6. Load Processed Data into BigQuery

For high-performance querying and analysis:

- **BigQuery**: A fully managed, serverless data warehouse ideal for analytical workloads.
- **Batch ingestion from GCS**:
  - Store raw/processed files in GCS.
  - Load final data batches into BigQuery tables.
- **Hybrid strategy**:
  - Use GCS for storage and pre-processing with Parquet.
  - Export final datasets to BigQuery for reporting, dashboards, and ad-hoc analysis.
